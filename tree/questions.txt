//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: breadth first search

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (DFS will take long)

//If the tree is very wide: DFS (BFS need to much memeory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

//Finding the shortest path: BFS
